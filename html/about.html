                    <h2>What makes me me?</h2>
                    <p>My mom was 12 months pregnant with me. Surprising!!! I'm the youngest child and the only boy in a family of five children. Due to traditional aspects, this always holds true no matter how many children my parents have. I've been surrounded by numerous talented people since my childhood, which always motivates me to learn new things as well as approach challenges. Other than that, I particularly love playing acoustic guitar and making my own song arrangements.</p>

                    <p>I was born and lived in Vietnam for many years. That is, I experienced various social, cultural, environment, and life aspects in my hometown. My education is no exception. I pursued a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunications. Upon graduation, I worked as an embedded software engineer and R&D software engineer for a couple of years.</p>

                    <h3>... then relocated to Southern California</h3>
                    <p>Back in 2019, I immigrated to Southern California and began my new life in such a promising and wonderful land. I switched my major and primarily pursued an associate's degree in Computer Science at Mt. San Jacinto College. Besides, I got two additional associate's degrees at the same time, respectively Liberal Arts and Math.</p>

                    <p>This was a huge change in my life with regard to independency and lifestyle. Having said that, I enjoy the experiences I have here. I committed to the University of California, Berkeley in Fall 2022 and am working toward a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.</p>
